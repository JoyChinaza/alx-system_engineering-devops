Postmortem: The Great Load Balancer Debacle of July 14, 2024
Issue Summary:
Duration: July 14, 2024, 10:15 AM - 12:30 PM UTC (aka “The Longest 2 Hours and 15 Minutes of Our Lives”).
Impact: 90% of users experienced a digital blackout. 😱 Imagine your favorite streaming service suddenly showing nothing but cat videos on loop—that’s the kind of disruption we’re talking about. Users couldn’t log in, couldn’t access services, and probably couldn’t calm their rising panic.
Root Cause: A “tiny” load balancer configuration change that snowballed into a traffic jam of epic proportions. Who knew one little rule could cause such a ruckus? 🚧
Timeline:
10:20 AM: Monitoring alert: “Bad Gateway? More like No Gateway! Help!” pops up on screens. 🚨
10:25 AM: On-call engineer—let’s call him “Hero of the Day”—dives in, thinking it’s the same old database drama. Spoiler: It wasn’t. 🦸‍♂️
10:30 AM: Database checks out just fine, thank you very much. Meanwhile, users are starting to send SOS signals on social media. 📱😩
10:40 AM: Network team joins the party, ensuring all firewalls and DNS are behaving. Turns out they were perfect angels. 😇
11:00 AM: Wait a minute… why isn’t traffic getting to the backend servers? Something smells fishy. 🐟
11:15 AM: A wild goose chase through the application code begins. False alarm—nothing’s wrong there. 🤷‍♂️
11:30 AM: Lightbulb moment: the load balancer! 💡 We trace back to a recent configuration change that’s wreaking havoc.
11:45 AM: Rollback time! We hit the “undo” button on that configuration faster than you can say “bottleneck.” 🔄
12:00 PM: The system breathes a sigh of relief as traffic flows freely once more. 🌬️
12:30 PM: All systems are go, users are happy, and the incident is officially slain. 🎉
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: A misconfigured load balancer rule decided to play traffic cop and slowed everything down to a crawl. 🐢 This innocent-looking change throttled incoming traffic to the point where users were left stranded at the “login” screen.
Resolution: We reverted the load balancer to its previous, happier self. 😌 Once the rollback was in place, traffic resumed its usual speed and users were able to access the app without further drama.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:

Lesson 1: Load balancers are not toys. Handle with care. 🤖
Lesson 2: More monitoring = fewer surprises. Let’s catch these issues before they catch us. 🕵️‍♀️
Lesson 3: Rollback procedures should be smoother than butter. 🧈
TODO:

Task 1: Upgrade the load balancer’s logging to give us a heads-up next time someone thinks they’re smarter than the system. 📝
Task 2: Install monitoring that pings us if traffic suddenly decides to take a coffee break. ☕
Task 3: Educate the team on the dark arts of load balancing. Knowledge is power, after all. 🧙‍♂️
Task 4: Perfect our rollback procedures—because nobody likes fumbling for the undo button in a crisis. 🛠️
 (Note: This diagram is more fun if you imagine tiny cars zipping around the lanes of traffic.) 🚗🚙🚕

And that, dear reader, is how we wrestled a wayward load balancer back into submission and restored digital harmony. ✌️ Stay tuned for more adventures in web stack debugging!
